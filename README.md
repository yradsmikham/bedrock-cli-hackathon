# Bedrock CLI

Bedrock CLI is an open-source project that was developed to supplement Project Bedrock. It is a wrapper for `terraform`, `az` cli, and `kubectl` in order to extend features in Bedrock. 

This command line tool will help simplify the automation and management of your Kubernetes resource deployments across clusters and environments, allowing you to rollout processes and find deployment issues more quickly.
